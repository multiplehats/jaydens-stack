  Jayden's Stack ‚ú®
 </h1>
</p>

Welcome to Jayden's Stack üëã, a modern, efficient, and feature-packed monorepo boilerplate focused on SvelteKit. This project is all about enhanced developer experience, massive scalability, and high performance.

Give me a [follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/itschrisjayden) for updates. And if you dig this repo, don't forget to give it a star ‚≠êÔ∏è

> **Note** <br> **This is quite an opinionated monorepo** <br> But, it's the exact structure I've used to build several production apps. And for me (and team members) it totally rocks. Over time, I might add additional utitilies and other libraries, but I'm trying to keep things "simple" (for my own sake).

## But, I don't need "X"
When building this monorepo template, I tried to make it so that if you don't need something, it's relatively easy to eject. There might be some manual work involved if you want to get rid of something (sorry, no fancy CLI's yet), but the main goal here is to save myself time and hopefully yours! üéâ

## Todos / Features

- [ ] Spin tRPC off into its own package.
- [ ] Integrate Prisma + Planetscale
- [ ] Incorporate AuthJS.

## Featured Technologies
- **tRPC**: Enables you to make end-to-end typesafe APIs like a ninja. It allows for the freedom of serverless applications without lock-ins and can be easily spun into a standalone server.
- **TanStack Query**: Your utility belt for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data. Its integration with tRPC and SvelteKit is just flawless.
- **SvelteKit**: A UI framework that's built on Svelte, enabling you to write stunningly concise components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that lets you create modern websites in record time without ever leaving your HTML.
- **Shadcn Svelte**: Offers beautifully designed components without any lock-in. Just copy and paste them into your project. Simple as that!
- **TurboRepo**: A Rust-built, incremental build system that's optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Voila! You now have a local running instance of Jayden's Stack!

## Adding shadcn components

Adding new components is pretty simple, you can either manually over components to the `packages/ui` directory. Or, `cd` into `apps/web` and run the shadcn CLI command, e.g. `npx shadcn-svelte add accordion`. This will put the new component in the `packages/ui` directory.

Don't forget to update imports ‚úåÔ∏è
